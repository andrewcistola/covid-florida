## About this Repository
This repository is a collection of open source resources developed to conduct retrospective analysis on confirmed cases of COVID-19 by the Florida Department of Health in 2020. 
The data used for these analyses come directly from the public reports taken from the Florida DOH website for open consumption. 
Because the public data has been disseminated in PDF form, some transcription and manipulation was requred to reproduce into format for this analysis. Within the subrepositories for each particualr data release (each folder is named with the month day and time) there is full documentation of the raw data and tseps taken to transcribe into a usable format.

No information is included in this repository that is not available to any memeber of the public.
